# Major Project
## Item placement Strategy - Warehouse Optimization

## Github branch strategy 

- for each new feature (ex. new crossover, new fitness , new mutation) create a new branch from main : ex- surya/bd-xyz-crossover
- work on your name branch (ex. surya, shubha) and raise the PR on feature branch (not on main branch) 
- Leave the "basic-draft-do-not-touch" unchanged, unless there is some optimization or refactoring which will improve all versions.
